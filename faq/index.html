					<p><b>Arduino</b> is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.</p>

					<h3>Power (USB / Barrel Jack)</h3>
					<p>Every Arduino board needs a way to be connected to a power source. The Arduino UNO can be powered from a USB cable coming from your computer or a wall power supply that is terminated in a barrel jack. In the picture above the USB connection is labeled (1) and the barrel jack is labeled (2).
					The USB connection is also how you will load code onto your Arduino board.</p><br>
					<h3>Pins (5V, 3.3V, GND, Analog, Digital, PWM, AREF)</h3>
					<p>The pins on your Arduino are the places where you connect wires to construct a circuit (probably in conjuction with a breadboard and some wire. They usually have black plastic ‘headers’ that allow you to just plug a wire right into the board. The Arduino has several different kinds of pins, each of which is labeled on the board and used for different functions.<br>
					GND (3): Short for ‘Ground’. There are several GND pins on the Arduino, any of which can be used to ground your circuit. <br>
					5V (4) &amp; 3.3V (5): As you might guess, the 5V pin supplies 5 volts of power, and the 3.3V pin supplies 3.3 volts of power. Most of the simple components used with the Arduino run happily off of 5 or 3.3 volts. <br>
					Analog (6): The area of pins under the ‘Analog In’ label (A0 through A5 on the UNO) are Analog In pins. These pins can read the signal from an analog sensor (like a temperature sensor) and convert it into a digital value that we can read. <br>
					Digital (7): Across from the analog pins are the digital pins (0 through 13 on the UNO). These pins can be used for both digital input (like telling if a button is pushed) and digital output (like powering an LED). <br>
					PWM (8): You may have noticed the tilde (~) next to some of the digital pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 on the UNO). These pins act as normal digital pins, but can also be used for something called Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM).<br>
					AREF (9): Stands for Analog Reference. Most of the time you can leave this pin alone. It is sometimes used to set an external reference voltage (between 0 and 5 Volts) as the upper limit for the analog input pins. </p>
					<h3>Reset Button</h3>
					<p>The Arduino has a reset button (10). Pushing it will temporarily connect the reset pin to ground and restart any code that is loaded on the Arduino. This can be very useful if your code doesn’t repeat, but you want to test it multiple times.</p>
					<h3>Power LED Indicator</h3>
					<p>Just beneath and to the right of the word “UNO” on your circuit board, there’s a tiny LED next to the word ‘ON’ (11). This LED should light up whenever you plug your Arduino into a power source. If this light doesn’t turn on, there’s a good chance something is wrong. Time to re-check your circuit!</p>
					<h3>TX RX LEDs</h3>
					<p>TX is short for transmit, RX is short for receive. These markings appear quite a bit in electronics to indicate the pins responsible for serial communication. In our case, there are two places on the Arduino UNO where TX and RX appear – once by digital pins 0 and 1, and a second time next to the TX and RX indicator LEDs (12). These LEDs will give us some nice visual indications whenever our Arduino is receiving or transmitting data (like when we’re loading a new program onto the board).</p>
					<h3>Main IC</h3>
					<p>The black thing with all the metal legs is an IC, or Integrated Circuit (13). Think of it as the brains of our Arduino. The main IC on the Arduino is slightly different from board type to board type, but is usually from the ATmega line of IC’s from the ATMEL company. This can be important, as you may need to know the IC type (along with your board type) before loading up a new program from the Arduino software. This information can usually be found in writing on the top side of the IC. If you want to know more about the difference between various IC’s, reading the datasheets is often a good idea.</p>
					<h3>Voltage Regulator</h3>
					<p>The voltage regulator (14) is not actually something you can (or should) interact with on the Arduino. But it is potentially useful to know that it is there and what it’s for. The voltage regulator does exactly what it says – it controls the amount of voltage that is let into the Arduino board. Think of it as a kind of gatekeeper; it will turn away an extra voltage that might harm the circuit. Of course, it has its limits, so don’t hook up your Arduino to anything greater than 20 volts.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Your first program!</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Inside the arduino IDE, we define 2 non-returning functions -<br>
						1) setup() : Used to initialise variables, pin modes, libraries etc<br>
						2) loop() : The code which goes in here runs infinitely<br><br>
					</p>
					<h3>1) void setup() : </h3><p>This non-returning method is used to set-up the board before beginning to use it.
						The setup function will only run once, after each powerup or reset of the Arduino board.
						Setting up involves initialising the GPIOs using pinMode([pin], [state]), 
						beginning the Serial Communication at a particular baud-rate using Serial.begin([baud-rate]).<br><br>
					</p>
					<h3>1) void loop() : </h3><p>After creating the setup() function, which initializes and sets the initial values, the loop() function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. Use it to actively control the Arduino board. <br>
					The main code statements go inside this function.<br><br>
